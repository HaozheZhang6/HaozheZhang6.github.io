Hii, welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a cell engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), working on next generation in-house cell. Before joining Tesla, I finished my PhD in mechanical engineering at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). My advisor was [Baoxing Xu](https://xugroup.weebly.com/). My research was centered around designing metastructures and developing numerical models under mechanical framework to analyze physical properties of soft-hard integrated materials and structures. 

In the summer of 2022, I joined [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/) as a research intern. Worked with the packaging R&D team, my research was focus on solid drive drop tests. I developed a criteria using the simulation results from FEA to predict the corresponding test performance with neural networks, which allow the team to easily know if the design meet our customers' requirement.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games and spending time with friends.
