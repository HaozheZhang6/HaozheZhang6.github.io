Hey, welcome to my page! 👋

I’m a modeling engineer at **Tesla**, where I work at the intersection of physics-based modeling and machine learning for next-generation battery cells. My work spans theoretical+computational modeling, reinforcement learning for automation and data-driven methods for performance optimization, and scale-up.

Beyond physics, I’m deeply enthusiastic about and specialize in **large language models (LLMs)** and **agentic systems**, with hands-on experience building LLM-powered voice-agent ([krono](https://www.laurion.com)), and RL-based infrastructure for decision-making and automation.

Before Tesla, I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from **University of Virginia (UVA)**  and BS from **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and playing video games (League).
