Hiii, welcome to my page! 👋

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher, currently working as a cell research engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) on next-generation in-house cell technology. My core expertise lies in developing and applying advanced Machine Learning and data-driven strategies to solve complex engineering challenges.

Before joining Tesla, I finished my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). My advisor was [Baoxing Xu](https://xugroup.weebly.com/). My research was centered around designing meta-structures and developing numerical models under mechanical framework to analyze physical properties of soft-hard integrated materials and structures. A key aspect of my research was the integration of ML techniques to bridge the gap between simulations and physical properties, accelerating material discovery and analysis.

In the summer of 2022, I joined [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/) as a research intern. Worked with the packaging R&D team, my research was focus on solid drive drop tests. I leveraged neural networks to predict drop test performance from FEA simulation results, creating a criterion that streamlined the design verification process and allowed the team to easily know if the design met our customers' requirement.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games and spending time with friends.
