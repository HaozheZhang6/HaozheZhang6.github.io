Hi 👋🙂

I am an M.S. Graduate in Computer Science (December 2021) from [San Jose State University](https://www.sjsu.edu/cs/programs/mscs/) and a firm believer in lifelong learning. I enjoy writing and testing well-documented, reproducible and robust code to solve exciting yet challenging computer science questions.

My primary research interest is in machine learning (ML) and user privacy. This led me to pursue research in privacy-preserving AI as part of [my M.S. thesis project](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/etd_projects/1052/).

Besides academic research, my industry experience includes internships at the Silicon Valley fintech startup, [Zact](https://www.zact.com/) , and at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/). During my undergraduate studies, I also worked as a Student Contractor at [Delphi Electronics & Safety Verification Lab](https://www.borgwarner.com/delphi-technologies).

Besides 👩‍💻, I enjoy 🏕️, 🍱, and 📸.
