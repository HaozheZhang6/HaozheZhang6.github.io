We design and engineer smart soft contact lenses for continuous remote assessment of ocular health and chronic diseases. These devices are built upon various commercial brands of soft contact lenses that offer ergonomic designs to safely fit a variety of corneal shapes and sizes in human eyes. The pragmatic applicaiton of these devices is boundless ranging from (1) at-home management of chronic ocular diseases such as glaucoma to (2) painless ocular drug delivery and to (3) contact lens research and development.
