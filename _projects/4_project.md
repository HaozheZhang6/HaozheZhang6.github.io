Micro/nanofluidic devices and systems have attracted ever-growing attention in healthcare applications over the past decades due to low-cost yet easy-customizable functions with the demand of only a small volume of sample fluid. The continuous development, in particular, supported by the emerging of new materials, capable of meeting critical needs in next-generation, wearable, and multifunctional biomedical devices for at-home, personalized healthcare monitoring is challenging the principles and strategies of structural design, manufacturing, and their seamless integration. Our work is to develop mechanics-centered design and processing strategies and approaches for immediate applications in biomedical engineering and healthcare monitoring. Topics of interest include pain management electronic devices and porous materials-liquid based sensors and actuators.
