Monitoring the human bio-sigials including temperature and electrophysiological with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, yet powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards. One of my research interest is on designing and engineering smart devices for biomedical engineering and healthcare monitoring, for example: smart soft contact lenses and wearable sensor array.

The smart contact lense is for continuous remote assessment of ocular health and chronic diseases. These devices are built upon various commercial brands of soft contact lenses that offer ergonomic designs to safely fit a variety of corneal shapes and sizes in human eyes. The pragmatic applicaiton of these devices is boundless ranging from (1) at-home management of chronic ocular diseases such as glaucoma to (2) painless ocular drug delivery and to (3) contact lens research and development.
