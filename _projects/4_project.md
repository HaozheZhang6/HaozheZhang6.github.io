Monitoring the human bio-sigials including temperature and electrophysiological with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, yet powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards. One of my research interests is on designing and engineering smart devices for biomedical engineering and healthcare monitoring.

The smart contact lense we designed is for continuous remote assessment of ocular health and chronic diseases. These devices are built upon various commercial brands of soft contact lenses that offer ergonomic designs to safely fit a variety of corneal shapes and sizes in human eyes. The pragmatic applicaiton of these devices is boundless ranging from (1) at-home management of chronic ocular diseases such as glaucoma to (2) painless ocular drug delivery and to (3) contact lens research and development.

All-printed stretchable corneal sensor on soft contact lenses for noninvasive and painless ocular electrodiagnosis. **Nature Communications** 12 (2021) 1544 (* denotes equal contribution)

 To monitoring the body temperature with high accuracy, here we introduce ultrasensitive and stretchable gold-doped silicon nanomembrane (Au-doped SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array for the first time. The ultrasensitivity is achieved by shifting freeze-out region to intrinsic region in carrier density and modulation of fermi energy level of p-type SiNM through the development of a novel gold-doping strategy.
