  abstract  = {Engineering Janus structures that possess anisotropic features in functions have attracted growing attention for a wide range of applications in sensors, catalysis, and biomedicine, and are yet usually designed at the nanoscale with distinct physical or chemical functionalities in their opposite sides. Inspired by the seamless integration of soft and hard materials in biological structures, here we present a mechanical Janus structure composed of soft and hard materials with a dramatic difference of mechanical properties at additively manufacturable macroscale. We establish, in the combination of extensive experimental, theoretical, and computational studies, the design principle of soft-hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures and address their unique rotation mechanism. We further show the systematic studies of assembling the Janus structure units into superstructures with well-ordered organizations by programing their local rotations, providing a direct route of designing superstructures by leveraging mechanical Janus structures with unique soft-hard material integration. Applications are conducted to demonstrate the features and functionalities of assembled superstructures with local ordered organizations in regulating and filtering acoustic wave propagations, thereby providing exemplification applications of mechanical Janus design in functional structures and devices.},

  abstract  = {Confining liquid in a hydrophobic nanoenvironment has enabled a broad spectrum of applications in biomedical sensors, mechanical actuators, and energy storage and converters, where the outflow of confined liquid is spontaneous and fast due to the intrinsic hydrophobic nature of nanopores with extremely low interfacial friction, challenging design capacity and control tolerance of structures and devices. Here, we present a facile approach of suppressing the outflow of water confined in hydrophobic nanopores with an electric field. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that the presence of an electric field could significantly strengthen hydrogen bonds and retard degradations of the associated networks during the outflow. The outflow deformation and strength are extracted to quantitatively characterize the electrical suppression to outflow and agree well with simulations. This study proposes a practical means of impeding the fast liquid outflow in hydrophobic nanopores, potentially useful for devising nanofluidics-based functional structures and devices with controllable performance.},
