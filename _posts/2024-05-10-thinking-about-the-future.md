The future rarely arrives as a single grand reveal. It shows up as the accumulation of small experiments that change how we
collaborate, learn, and take care of each other. I have been thinking a lot about what that means for my own work and for the
communities I care about.

Technically, I expect the boundaries between physical and digital design to keep dissolving. We will prototype with responsive
materials that learn from their environment, and we will share those prototypes in immersive spaces that feel as tangible as any
lab bench. The teams that thrive in that landscape will be the ones that treat documentation, reproducibility, and mentorship as
first-class artifacts—not chores to be postponed.

Culturally, I hope the next decade rewards patience and empathy. Tools will continue to accelerate discovery, but their impact
will hinge on how intentionally we deploy them. Making room for diverse perspectives is not just a moral imperative; it is how we
avoid brittle solutions that ignore the realities of the people they aim to serve.

I stay hopeful because every project I join introduces me to collaborators who care about the same balance of rigor and wonder.
If we keep investing in that spirit, the future will feel less like something that happens to us and more like something we craft
together.
